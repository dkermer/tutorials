The word "Level" is used under many different circumstances in statistics. This is an attempt to list and distinguish them.

### Level of Measurement / Measurement Levels 

This refers to the mathematic properties of a measurement, such as whether the values represent categories or numeric measurements. Most students are taught about NOIR: Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio. But there are many other different ways to classify variables. See the article on Levels of Measurement. 

### Levels of a Variable

Catgories within categorical variables are also sometimes themselves called levels. 

### Level of Significance / Level of Confidence

In Null Hypothesis Significance testing, these both refer to the "amount" of evidence for a particular conclusion. Level of significance should refer to the alpha level that was used (ex. .05, .01), but it is often incorrectly referring to the p-value. Confidence is the complement to significance and is usually 95% or 99%. 

### Multi-level Models

Level can also refer to data nesting or data with variables at two different inits of observation. This is common in education when using both informtaion about teachers and information about the schools they teach in to make predictions. In this case, you would have the "teacher level", and the "school level", and thus a 2-level model.
