Data Science vs Science

<!--more-->

The Situation

**Data Scientists** often work with or expect to have the **same data** over and over again. Their goal is to **make predictions**.   

- The data is more likely to come from multiple systems or places, and involve date/time 
- The data is less likely to have been deliberately collected as data
- The model does not have to make theoretical sense (though those that do are often better)
- The model need not be simple (though simple can help with some applications)

**Research Scientists** typically try to get **different data** to find convergence. Their goal is to **explain**.  

- The model must make theoretical sense
- The model must be interpretable by others
