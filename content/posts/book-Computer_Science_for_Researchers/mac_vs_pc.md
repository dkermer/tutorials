An operating system is a software that facilitates other software on a computer.

PCs have **drive letters** (the main drive is typically C). Macs do not. 

To **separate the folder names** on a Mac or Unix-based system use a /, to separate them on a PC, use a \. Most programming languages (such as R), use the Unix-based system. To use a \, you can “escape” it with a \, and write \\. 

**Line breaks** (e.g. ,when you press the “Enter” Key) on Mac/Unix computers are represented with a single “line feed” character, often written “\n”. On a PC, you must use two characters, often written “\r\n”. If a file with Mac/Unix line endings is opened on a Windows computer, all the lines might run together. There are actually lots of problems that can be caused by this difference. Some text editors, like Notepad++, will display either properly. It also has a function to convert the line endings from one to the other. 

Macs use Bash as the command line, PC's use DOS (.bat) or PowerShell (.ps)





Characters that often have **special meaning** include: 

```
alone  :  \ | / + * . # ^ $ & ?  
paired :  "" '' ( )  [ ]  { }  < >
```
