Where problems occur:

- submitting the proper command	
  - Not executing
  - Line endings, closed parentheses
  - Wrong term, wrong spelling

- structure of your syntax for that command
  - the ordering is wrong
  - forgot symbols
  - put too many or not enough variables

- your data 
  - it's eliminating too many rows/observations
  - your values are different from what it expects
  - the variable types are wrong
  - you referred to a variable that doesn't exist (misspelled it?)





What happened?

- Nothing
  - Did you submit the command?
  - Did it actually do something, you just didn't notice?
  - Did your data justify the change?
  - Did you tell it to save the result?

- Error Message
  - Try to identify which of the above places the error is referring to
    - Check anything it mentions and right before it
  - Check spelling, syntax structure, and all variables referred to
  - Start with something that you know works and make minor changes to it to bring it closer to what you want to do. Use the examples if needed. 
- Something
  - Try to understand what it did do
  - Check the documentation 
  - Start smaller
