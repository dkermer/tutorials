In order to discuss data, it is necessary to have and use the right words for what you are doing. 

- Variable: A column of a dataset, with a variable name in the header that can be used to refer to the entire column of values. 

- Value: A cell in a data table. 

- Vector: A series of values that are the same type. Equivalent to a variable, but not necessarily in a data frame.
